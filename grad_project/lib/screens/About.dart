But you\n might be able to stop treatment if your\n seizures disappear over time.\nLiving with epilepsy\nEpilepsy is usually a lifelong condition, but \nmost people with it are able to have normal \nlives if their seizures are well controlled.\nMost children with epilepsy are able to go to \na mainstream school, take part in most\n activities and sports, and get a job when \nthey\'re older.\nBut you may have to think about your epilepsy\n before you do things such as driving, certain\n jobs, swimming, using contraception and \nplanning a pregnancy.\nAdvice is available from a GP or support \ngroups to help you adjust to life with epilepsy.\nFind out more about living with epilepsy\nCauses of epilepsy\nIn epilepsy, the electrical signals in the brain\n become scrambled and there are sometimes \nsudden bursts of electrical activity. This is what\n causes seizures.\nIn most cases, it\'s not clear why this happens.\n It\'s possible it could be partly caused by your \ngenes affecting how your brain works, as \naround 1 in 3 people with epilepsy have a \nfamily member with it.\nOccasionally, epilepsy can be caused by \ndamage to the brain, such as damage from:\na stroke\na brain tumour\na severe head injury\ndrug abuse or alcohol misuse\na brain infection\na lack of oxygen during birth\nPage last reviewed: 18 September 2020\nNext review due: 18 September 2023',
